# Python typed template üêç

[![Build](https://github.com/tekumara/python-typed-template/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tekumara/python-typed-template/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A minimal, generic, and opinionated template for **typed ‚ú®** python projects that includes:

- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) as a task runner
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management
- [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for linting
- [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) for type checking
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for running the above as hooks
- a [GHA ci workflow]({{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/.github/workflows/ci.yml) that runs hooks every commit

Type hints are enforced. Uses a [flat layout](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/src-layout-vs-flat-layout/), ie: packages are defined at the top level. Naming conventions are as per PEP8, see [Template parameters](#template-parameters) below. And not much else. This is meant to be generic, so anything specific to only a subset of projects probably lives elsewhere.

For more info see [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Project development prerequisites

Projects created using this template have [development prerequisites]({{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/CONTRIBUTING.md#Prerequisites).

## Template parameters

The template will ask for the following:

- `repo_name`: The name of your repo. Repo names are lowered kebab-case, so hyphens rather than underscores, to be kind to humans.
- `package_name`: The name of your main python package. A python package is a group of modules, ie: a directory with _\_\_init\_\_.py_ file. Choose a short all-lowercase name without hyphens. The use of underscores is discouraged (see [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names)).
- `project_name`: The name of the artifact when your project is built as a wheel. Project names are [lowered kebab-case](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/#names). In most cases the package name and project name will be the same. This is used in _pyproject.toml_ and needed even if you aren't building a wheel.
- `description`: a one line description of your project.

## Getting started

[cruft](DESIGN.md#cruft) is recommended for creating projects.

To create a project, aka bake a cookie üç™, using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and cruft:

```
uvx cruft create git@github.com:tekumara/python-typed-template.git
# replace repo-name below with the name you specified during template creation
cd repo-name
git init && git commit -m 'root commit' --allow-empty
make install
```
